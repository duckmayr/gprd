\arguments{
\item{x}{A object of class \code{\link{gprd}}}

\item{from}{A numeric vector of length one giving the lowest x value
to plot prediction for; if \code{NULL}, only values in the training
data and at the cutoff are plotted}

\item{to}{A numeric vector of length one giving the highest x value
to plot prediction for; if \code{NULL}, only values in the training
data and at the cutoff are plotted}

\item{n_points}{An integer vector of length one giving the number of
prediction points to plot; if \code{NULL} and \code{from} and \code{to}
are given, \code{n_points = length(seq(from = from, to = to, by = 0.01))}}

\item{ci_width}{A numeric vector of length one between 0 and 1 giving
the width of the confidence interval for tau}

\item{data_color}{A color to plot the data points in}

\item{line_color}{A color to plot the predictive mean line in}

\item{ci_color}{A color to plot the CI polygon in}

\item{plot_cutoff}{A logical vector of length one; if \code{TRUE}, a dashed
vertical line (\code{lty = 2}) marks the cutoff; default is \code{TRUE}}

\item{main_title}{A character vector of length one giving a main title for
the plot}

\item{xlab}{A character vector of length one giving a title for the x axis}

\item{ylab}{A character vector of length one giving a title for the y axis}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to \code{\link[graphics]{plot}}}
